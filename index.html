            <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
            <p>
                - Players pick out figurines from a dustbag and get assigned their random characters.<br>
                - The "Nepotism baby" player starts each round. If "Nepotism Baby" is not drawn, all players spin a wheel, and the highest scorer goes first, with the order proceeding clockwise.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Movement</h2>
            <p>
                - Players move by spinning the wheels.<br>
                - If a player gets the "Nepotism baby" figurine, their movement is always doubled throughout the game.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Gameplay Interactions</h2>
            <p>
                - Players may land on spaces that allow them to pick up "Opportunity" or "Activity" cards.<br>
                - Actions from different players can affect others' positions on the board, mirroring real-world industry dynamics.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
            <p>
                - To win, a player must have at least one "Opportunity" card.<br>
                - Players must land exactly on the finish line to win. If a player is near the finish line but cannot land exactly on it on their round, they must continue around the board.<br>
                - A player can also win if they land on an "Activity" card space that moves them directly onto the finish line, even if the move is not exact.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Board Navigation</h2>
            <p>
                - The board does not have a pre-set direction for spaces, allowing for nonlinear progression.
            </p>

            <h2>Moral of the Game</h2>
            <p>
                The real-life objective of this game is to demonstrate the imbalance of the corporate world in different settings. Do we all truly have the same chances? Are we treated the same when entering a work field? Different privileges can give you different benefits. This game is supposed to show different challenges that you can face in the real world and is supposed to spark dialogue to create potential changes within the industry we wish to work for.

            <h2>End Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The winner will be the first who crosses the finish line.
